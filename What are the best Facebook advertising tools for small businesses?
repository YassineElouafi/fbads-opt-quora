For small businesses I think keeping as much cash in your own accounts is important.

The standard Facebook Ad Manager interface, tells you so much information that it‚Äôs hard to say there are better tools available.

The information, could be presented in a more visual way, but once you learn how to break down data, it‚Äôs the simplest and cheapest (free) too to use.

I‚Äôll add that Reveal is looking like a valuable automation tool once someone has enough return on adspend to justify it. (I‚Äôm testing now).

Creative rotation and building multiple ads at once were once features that saved so much time in Qwaya and Adespresso. But now that Facebook released dynamic ad creative, I have a hard time recommending these.

In case you need to see certain data and access it quickly, I‚Äôd suggest hiring (or finding) someone to customize your default data columns.

This is something I do for clients when they hire my company to run ads for them. I set up a default data set so they can see specifically the data they need/want to see, how much it costs and how much they are making.

Over the past few years, the answer to this question has changed but I think it‚Äôs difficult to look beyond Power Editor as the best free ad management software. Or if you want to be more specific and/or advanced, a combination of Power Editor and Microsoft Excel. Add to the mix a good, analytical brain and you‚Äôre pretty much there!

I‚Äôve been involved in running FB ads for over 7 years. I spent 2010 to 2015 running Facebook Ads FMP (or PMD) businesses in Europe, most latterly Nanigans. When I left (2015), more and more clients and potential customers were choosing Power Editor over our solution. And these are large-scale advertisers pretty much uniformly spending over $50K/month. If Power Editor is good enough for them, then it‚Äôs likely good enough for lower spending advertisers also.

Some of its advantages include:

Power Editor is developed by Facebook
It allows you to easily manage your account as it scales letting you make bulk changes and operates in an offline mode so that edits don‚Äôt go live until you publish it
Where previously FMPs/PMDs led the way in terms of bid optimisation, Facebook‚Äôs own algorithms have caught up to the extent that in many cases, running Facebook‚Äôs optimised bidding is the best solution.
Similarly some of the other key reasons for using a 3rd party provider have gone since Power Editor has been improved; these include ability to bulk split ad sets by age and other variables as well as rules-based optimisation (or ‚ÄúAutomated Rules‚Äù as Facebook calls it).
The Excel export feature lets you export the entire account into an Excel spreadsheet in which you can make granular changes to your ads, bids, budgets etc, and then quickly upload everything back into the account for all the changes to happen.
The majority of new Facebook ad features these days will be released straight into Power Editor. The ad partners will need time to build these out (this was always a big issue at my previous companies) and get them into their products, so in terms of early adopter advantage for these new features, you can‚Äôt beat Power Editor.
In terms of what you can do in Excel once you‚Äôve downloaded the account, the possibilities are pretty much endless:

(Bulk) change any variable, including ad status, bids, ad copy, landing page, targeting
You can use pivot tables to sort and gain insights from looking at the data in different dimensions
For example, you can look at performance by country, device, or indeed country and device and make optimisations based on what you see. E.g. if Android performs badly in France, you can exclude it completely or reduce your bids
It allows you to quickly sort by performance, spend or whatever you prioritise so that you can quickly make decisions and cut out the inefficient segments and focus on where the majority of budget is spent or performance is driven.
Hopefully this helps. If you feel inspired to learn more about the best ways of running Facebook ads, we‚Äôve been teaching marketers all over the world for the past couple of years and have translated our in-person workshop into an online learning experience, check it out here!

Based on my experience using Facebook Ads for my site (an experiment I'm doing in local news gathering), here's what I'd suggest:

1. Start by making sure your business Facebook page is active and up-to-date. Update it regularly for at least a week (preferably more) before you buy ad ad. (What's happening at your business? Are there coupons? Special deals? Were you in the local paper? Is there something going on in the community that your business has some connection to? Be sure to point people from your Facebook page to your business website, as well.)

2. Use your Facebook Ad to promote your Facebook page, rather than your business website. This gives users something familiar when they click on the link. Once they get there, it's up to you to provide something that will keep them there (see No. 1, above).
Why point people to your Facebook page? Because you can see the effect more clearly. You can watch your "likes" increase and make rapid decisions about whether the ad campaign you're running is working.

3. When creating the ad, be sure to target it as specifically as possible. Begin with a small target of the people most likely to be interested (I targeted small business owners and people who liked "news" in a single zip code, for starters). When the number of "likes" starts to get more respectable, you can broaden your targeting to people who might be slightly less interested but who might be persuaded to "join" by the number of "likes" your page has.

4. Don't be afraid to bid on the low end of the suggested price. I bid below the lowest suggested price and my ad was accepted. If it's not accepted, just go back and raise your bid. (Note: The actual cost I paid was below the bid in some instances).

5. Keep your daily budget low. I only wanted to spend $100 for starters, so I started my daily budget at $10. I paid for each click on my ad, but when it hit $10 in a day, my ad disappeared. This way, I was able to keep expenses in check while getting a good read on the ad's success.

My efforts tripled my "likes" in about a month, but I was a new service in what I considered to be an underserved market. Plus, my "experiment" was entirely free. Can't promise you'll have the same results, but still figured I'd share. I also was able to start the campaign with fewer than 100 likes, although another answerer says you need 100 minimum. I'd suggest checking that out if you're under 100, as it worked fine for me. Good luck!

This is very important. Please pay close attention, many small companies really drop the ball on this.

What is the purpose of your company existing online?

This is what your online marketing needs to reflect. Are you there to create online sales? To generate leads? For exposure?

Once you know why you exist, then and only then can you begin strategizing. Each purpose should have a different strategy with a different tool.

I go over all of this in my online marketing and sales generating training. Check it out! Hope this helps. Best of luck!

I guess for any kind of business there are basically only 2 options when it comes to advertising:

Advertising on your own: Which means using huge banner advertisement and putting it up on the side of the roads to catch everyone‚Äôs attention or learn a few programs by wasting your valuable time in order to advertise at places that are not exactly familiar to you.
Hire an Advertising agency: The better choice. Instead of you tediously fondling around with different softwares and trying to figure out what to do, you can be smarter and hire someone to do it for you. Using algorithms and different methods to enable marketing automation, the marketing firm will target the right audience on a global scale and see to it that your product is properly promoted to the right age group, gender, and whatever other categories that are relevant.
To me, option 2 seems better obviously since I would save valuable time and money by hiring experts to do this task instead of a inexperienced user trying to promote things in a futile manner.

It is also important to make a difference between running your own Facebook campaigns and going for a fully managed service.
 
If you are running your own campaigns Facebook offers the self-service tool and the power editor. Both are great but once you get the grip of advanced Facebook advertising you will probably need a more sophisticated tool to get more bang for your buck.
 
Once you take the leap to use a third party tool it is important the tool is intuitive and easy to use. 
 
Also, make sure the tool you choose offers you some kind of basic optimization functionality like ad scheduling, conversion tracking and ad rotation. 
 
Anther important difference with most serious 3rd party tool providers and the tools provided by Facebook is that you can manage a large amount of campaigns in a structured way. For example, at Qwaya we offer you campaign folders to segment your campaigns in a structured way that fits you, and your way of organizing.  However, most third party tools have great ways of organizing the campaigns.
 
Of course, your budget will also influence what kind of tool you should choose. Most tool providers charge you a % of Facebook spend or a minimum flat rate of $500/monthly minimum. So, if your budget is large a % of spend perhaps wont hurt you that much, but if you have a monthly budget of a few thousand dollars the $500 monthly will hurt you more.

'Sponsored Stories' are a great tool for businesses just starting out. All you need is at least a 100 people "Like"ing your page. Sponsored Stories are like items in the news feed showing friends of your fans that their friend likes your page. These do not seem like ads, and are likely to attract a significant CTR (Click Through Rate).

A few tips if you want to go ahead with Sponsored Stories:
‚Äì make sure you have a simple and attractive page profile picture.
‚Äì choose a broad demographic (and choose to pay per click when starting out)
‚Äì bid on the higher end of the suggested range
‚Äì be ready to spend at least $100-$200 on experimentation till you get it 'right'
‚Äì have posts on your page that entice the person who lands on it to visit your website (conversion)

There is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach- you need to spend some time experimenting and monitoring the ads' performance. The most successful ads utilize the 'social' element of Facebook.

Good luck!

Very good question! With so many different tools out there finding the right one is becoming more and more difficult. I have been doing Facebook advertising for about 3 years now and starting out it was very hard. I found myself spending ridiculous amounts of money trying to target people who were looking for my products. I must have played with the audience insight tool for hours and hours before I gave up and said, ‚Äúthere has to be an easier way to do this‚Äù. Luckily for me there was and it was a pure money and life saver.

Now before I came across this tool I‚Äôm going to recommend. I spent about $789.45 (I kept track of every penny) in advertising and didn‚Äôt even come close to a return on investment. Was I pissed heck yea I was pissed and ready to give up on affiliate marketing and Facebook advertising.

Then the ‚ÄúSocial Interest Freak‚Äù swooped down and saved me from the pain and agony I was going through. I‚Äôm going give you a brief breakdown of what I experienced before and after ‚ÄúSocial Interest Freak‚Äù.

Before SIF: I spent $30 on an ad set that I had set to target people who wanted to ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù I entered in all the demographics that was needed to target the perfect audience (So I Thought). 5 days had gone by and I only received 240 clicks and 12 conversions. Even though I profited $175.00 It still wasn‚Äôt the results I was looking for.

After SIF: I spent the same $30 on an ad set but this time I let the ‚ÄúSocial Interest Freak‚Äù (Software) do the targeting for me. I let the ad run for the same 5-day time frame but this time I received 867 clicks and 312 conversions. I profited over $1300 this time using the ‚ÄúSocial Interest Freak‚Äù.

Ever since then I been using the ‚ÄúSocial Interest Freak‚Äù and I have made over $47,000 all thanks to this software. I have put several of my friends on to this tool and each one of them has seen over 10k their first month of using it so I‚Äôm a firm believer in this.

There is a video explaining it much better than I can. ‚ÄúSocial Interest Freak‚Äù I hope this helps you as much as its helped me. It‚Äôs a real life changing tool for anyone who is serious about advertising on Facebook.

While Facebook's native advertising tools often have its limitations, the third-party tools (such as Catvertiser.com) always try to improve their features and offerings in order to provide their customers with the best experience with Facebook ads.
If you already decided to do advertising, do it properly. Do not advertise for the sake of advertising. It will be waste of your time and money.  

If you agree with the above statements, you should start choosing the tool. It would be wrong for me to say which one is the best, as it depends on individual preferences. Nevertheless, my skills, competencies and professional responsibilities allow me to advise you Catvertiser.com.

The best advertising tool for a small advertiser is the Facebook ad manager itself. All things that you cannot do using ads manager, can be done using a free Facebook tool called power editor. There are a few FMP tools that build a dashboard over Facebook‚Äôs ad dashboard and help you optimize campaigns better. Almost all of them end up working on a media commission model. For a small business with limited spends, it‚Äôs best to avoid them since overall both your cost and effort will increase.

Depends on whether you want a self service tool or a managed service.

Managed services tend to be useful as they will normally consist of a social media expert using a range of platforms to optimise performance. But it is more expensive and only worth doing if you can guarantee the ROI.

For a small business you want to make sure you have accurate and clean data before getting involved in Facebook - otherwise you will not be able to target your customers accurately enough to lower your CPLs. I'd recommend spending some money cleaning your data then either using a self service or going it alone.

I work for Experian and we offer the Alchemy Social platform which can be operated as a SAAS option (self service) or a managed service (which will also cater for other social media networks).
